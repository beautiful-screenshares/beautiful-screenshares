    <h1> Video Quality Matters </h1>
    <div class="sub-header">You are a having an amazing match, you can't remember the last time you made it this far. You are excited to read the chat after it is over</div>
    <div class="sub-header">Growth this quarter has been amazing. You are coming towards the end of your presentation. You can't wait to ask for questions</div>
    <p>
      You don't get the excited responses you expect though. Your content was diminished by the blurry text, muted colors and pixelation in your video.
      A low quality video distracts the user. Scroll down and see for yourself! Which video would you prefer in a conference call?

    <h1> How can I get better video? </h1>
    <div class="sub-header">Use a <a href="#Client">client</a> with WHIP support against a <a href="#Service">service</a> that supports WHIP.</div>
    <p>
      Instead of using a Web Browser (Chrome, Safari, FireFox etc..) or App you will use dedicated broadcasting software. This software gives you
      greater control of what you send, and the quality of it.
